# IncidentSeal devlog

## 2026-08-09 - Project authorization and custody

IncidentSeal was approved as a public, Apache-2.0, CLI-first developer verification product with a forensic-style local dashboard. The intended public repository is `drwbkr1/incidentseal`.

The original launch workspace was under OneDrive. The operator then declared OneDrive officially disconnected and prohibited its use. No project files had been created there. The canonical repository was created at `C:\Projects\Active\incidentseal` on an unborn `main` branch, and the OneDrive tree was recorded as forbidden custody.

Checkpoint `IS-0001` begins with documentation and dependency-free control records. Image pulls, package installation, Compose startup, and code dependencies remain gated until exact-source decisions exist.

## 2026-08-09 - Exact-image source gate

Public publisher, registry, license, OCI manifest, SLSA provenance, and SPDX SBOM metadata were reviewed for exact PostgreSQL 18.4 bookworm, Python 3.12.13 slim-bookworm, Node.js 24.19.0 bookworm-slim, and Dockerfile frontend 1.26.0 artifacts.

All 32 required source criteria passed. The decision authorizes only metadata retention, exact-digest recording, and a later non-executing pull for controlled inspection. It does not approve any image for runtime use or redistribution. No candidate image was pulled or run during this checkpoint.

## 2026-08-09 - First verified public checkpoint

The dependency-free baseline was committed as `b4cd51e466e8de89410b5ff58bf446a849a988d3`, pushed to the new public `drwbkr1/incidentseal` repository, and verified against remote `main`. The authenticated GitHub account, public visibility, default branch, origin URL, clean worktree, and local/remote commit equality all passed.

This closes `IS-0001` as a control and source-boundary checkpoint, not a software release. `IS-0002` now owns the manifest authority and stable CLI contract work.
